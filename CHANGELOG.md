# Mouse Labyrinth

## Changelog

### Version 1.1

I'm lucky to be able to continue working on this at home, so I can fix the issue with the high-score saving. The folder is now created programmatically, so you don't need to do so. Also, this changelog and a readme have been created.

### Version 1.0

This is the first version of the Mouse Labyrinth, written in an internship. The game is about moving a square to a goal with the mouse. It also features a high-score system.
